*--------------------------------------------------------
* Response file for installing DB2 into the DT docker image.
* Note that docker 0.6 does not support O_DIRECT, which
* DB2 requires, so we must mount the DB2 instance directory
* a /home/db2inst1 needs to be mounted loopback
* to a file somewhere in the container filesystem.
* mount -o loop=/dev/loop0 /db/disk-image /home/db2inst1 
* for this to work under docker.
